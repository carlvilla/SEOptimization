			<p>Bagpipes are a wind instrument using enclosed reeds fed from a constant reservoir of air in the form of a bag. Though the Scottish Great Highland bagpipes are the best known in the Anglophone world, bagpipes have been played for a millennium or more throughout large parts of Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia, including Turkey, the Caucasus, and around the Persian Gulf. The term "bagpipe" is equally correct in the singular or plural, although in the English language, pipers usually refer to the bagpipes as "the pipes", "a set of pipes" or "a stand of pipes."</p>      
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Bagpipe Symphony is the bagpipe provider of The Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association (RSPBA). This association organise events in Glasgow, such as championships or concerts. You can check it in this link: <a href="http://www.thepipingcentre.co.uk/bagpipe-education">Bagpipe Education</a>
